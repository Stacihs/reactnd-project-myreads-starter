# MyReads Project

This is a required project for Grow with Google Scholars/Udacity's Front End Developer Course. I was given starter code with included all the CSS and HTML markup. I had to contribute all the React code required to make the project functional.  

## How to run project

* Clone or fork project
* Using terminal, cd into the project file
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

A backend server was provided to develop against. The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Resources

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). It was built and tested with Google Chrome. Guidance was provided from a Youtube tutorial by [Doug Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=OcL7-7cRpkQ&feature=youtu.be).

## Contributing

Pull requests will not be accepted since this was an individual course project.
